# wikia-vector
Adds Vector skin support to Wikia. Requires Greasemonkey. 

Contains code from Wikipedia stylesheets, which are licensed under CC BY-SA and GFDL. (See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:C for more info).

This is in ALPHA, by which I mean it is in a barely usable state, so I recommend not using this until a more stable version is available... unless you REALLY hate Oasis like me.
